Resume-App
==========

I was offered an interview with Google so I wanted to do something to help stand out a bit. Thus, my Resume as an Android application. There is a lot I would like to change and add but given the time restraints on this, it was the best I could do.

## Time Spent So Far
 * 25 Hours
  * For those of you unfamiliar with hourly scales, this project has so far consumed four glasses of quality whiskey.

## Dependancies
 * [Rajawali 3D Engine](https://github.com/MasDennis/Rajawali)
  * Rajawali is used to drive the 3D background. I will likely swap this out for LibGDX to avoid the UI bug related to hardware acceleration being on. I believe LibGDX does not suffer this pain.

## Other
 * [Erin Creative Design](http://erincreativedesign.com/)
  * As with most of my work, Erin provided the application icon and gave general feedback. She is awesome and you should hire her too.
 * [Androton Action Bar Icons](https://github.com/svenkapudija/Androton-Action-Bar-Icons)
  * I used a few icons from this project. Unfortunately they do not specify a license so best I can do is give them credit.
